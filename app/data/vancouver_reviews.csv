VPqWLp9kMiZEbctCebIZUA	-D4T2oVxSjvVN9_owkEmyw	4	Medina Cafe is a cute/cozy spot for brunch. We visited during a snowstorm and the place was still packed, which blew our minds. Since there were so many rave reviews for this place, we figured we'd see what all the hype was about.<br><br>I had the Le Complet (2 Sunny Eggs, Flatiron Steak, Toasted Focaccia with Caramelized Onion and Roasted Red Pepper Chèvre, Romesco, Organic Greens) and hubby had the Fricassée (2 Sunny Eggs, Braised Short Ribs, Roasted Potatoes, Caramelized Onions, Smoked Cheddar, Arugula, Grilled Focaccia). <br><br>Both arrived beautifully plated and were delicious. We ended up sharing a waffle because I guess you can't come here without trying one, but were totally disappointed that it arrived ice cold. We ended up sending it back and they warmed it up for us, but it would've been nice if it had been freshly made in the first place. <br><br>Cute spot, good food, hectic atmosphere. Would visit again to try another waffle.	{'funny': 0, 'useful': 0, 'cool': 0}	9/18/2020

Last time I went to a restaurant was a year ago so I really have nothing to say about the ten places (I've obviously walked past) in recent months.	{'funny': 0, 'useful': 0, 'cool': 0}	9/9/2020

VPqWLp9kMiZEbctCebIZUA	iHX5dCiaetdHdbi6LXryIg	2	Went the other day with friends for brunch.  We waited an hour and a half to get in even though they told us it wouldn't be that long.<br>The service was very slow and by the time our brunch came everything was ice cold.. We couldn't be bothered to send it back because we were only there for brunch and this was becoming an all day experience.<br>The menu was unique however if you are expecting a typical brunch, it was not available. Based on first impressions all four of us said we wouldn't go back even though the reviews seem very positive.	{'funny': 0, 'useful': 0, 'cool': 0}	8/14/2020

VPqWLp9kMiZEbctCebIZUA	Hwz-EhpzkEw15zaJurBrWA	4	Such a great brunch spot! I can see what all the hype is about. <br><br>I ordered:<br>- the breakfast paella ( vegetarian substitute). I enjoyed this quite a bit and I'm glad they offer so many vegetarian options. <br>- waffles with chocolate pistachio and fig orange marmalade. Both really good flavours, there's a lot of icing and one waffle is not enough but I wanted to try 2 flavours anyways<br>- lavender latte with oat milk. Milk was perfectly frothed, the barista did a great job. The flavour of the lavender wasn't what I was looking for - it tasted a little artificial but for me it's quite rare to find a good lavender syrup for espresso drinks. If I return I'd try something else or just a plain latte. My sister ordered the turmeric latte and she said it was tasty! <br><br>Overall great place! The star of the brunch is definitely their famous waffles.	{'funny': 0, 'useful': 0, 'cool': 0}	7/22/2020
VPqWLp9kMiZEbctCebIZUA	TzwZbBAM3_4t7AGk8xfUog	3	Who the hell waits in line for two-half-hours to eat potatoes somewhere? The vibe I got was very much the 'let's take a photo so people know I made it through the door' kinda thing than people actually enjoying their time. Place to see and be seen, I guess.<br><br>The food is pretty good, great menu options and decent service. However, the owner(?) or manager(?) or random dude who brought my food(?) told me that no, I couldn't have salt because all the food is well-seasoned. He's not wrong, it was. Except, egg yolk without salt freaks me out, it's just a general palette thing. So, sure, if you're somehow managing to salt the inside of an unbroken egg yolk, then congrats on your magician skills. But since that's not likely, maybe just give me five seconds to explain before patronizing me and running away. <br><br>Good latte tho.	{'funny': 0, 'useful': 2, 'cool': 1}	7/18/2020

VPqWLp9kMiZEbctCebIZUA	7W7n-Wub7rJleVRaLiwN3A	5	Cafe Medina has some of the best breakfasts available in Vancouver. This issue is that everyone knows this in Vancouver.  The line-up are brutal, sometimes over an hour long.  I wish they got a bigger spot to hold more people.  The flavouring and freshness of their food is amazing very savoury, but it can be heavy.	{'funny': 0, 'useful': 0, 'cool': 0}	6/9/2020
VPqWLp9kMiZEbctCebIZUA	uLvGvr0URULKL2Is3pgyoA	4	The waffles, flatbread and roast potatoes are delicious. We also ordered a vegetarian frittata which looked very pretty but turned out to be very bland tasting. My friend got the granola which stated it was topped with 'fruits' but it only came with sliced apple :) Overall we enjoyed it but I would consider ordering eggs/sides a la carte next time rather than the frittata again.	{'funny': 0, 'useful': 0, 'cool': 0}	6/2/2020

VPqWLp9kMiZEbctCebIZUA	xhI05XbkihmVEUu_ClbV1Q	4	I came here to meet with my friend for lunch in January and he had no problem getting a table at 11am before the lunch rush, which was a first for me.  We're both experienced with eating out in town, and knew about the insane lineups that snake around the exterior of the place during breakfast most days. This lineup gets particularly scary looking during tourist seasons like summer and winter, so be sure to get there early and have someone willing to wait in line with you, or just put your name down and take a walk since wait times reach over an hour or two.  But this isn't surprising for an establishment after having won the Best Brunch Accolade in 2017 from the Vancouver Magazine Restaurant Awards.  <br><br>They have plenty of options for patrons to pick from in both sweet and savoury, which have been reduced on their online menu at the time being due to the ongoing COVID situation.  But during regular times, their most popular option that Medina was known for was their liege waffles.  If you want these waffles in a dinner setting, Chambar a few blocks away also serves liege waffles that are similar if not the same.  These do get a little pricey at $3.50 a waffle, the size of your palm, minus the fingers.  Then you also have to think about what sauces you want to go with that, and that's also an additional cost.  However, if you're here for a good time and want to treat yourself, then I would suggest the passionfruit topping or white chocolate pistachio rosewater topping.  They also had the option for a scoop of cardamom ice cream from local favourite, Earnest Ice Cream, a while back, which was a delicious addition to the waffles.<br><br>Waffles aside, my friend and I both got the Wolves Breakfast this time, which is a selection of 5 different meats and sausages with accompanying pickled veggies and purees.  Most of the choices had a spicy kick to them like what you'd find in Chorizo, which is something that I find with most if not all of their savoury choices on the menu, and it may overpower the meal if you're not used to this.  If you're the kind of person who likes to try a bit of everything, then this is the choice for you with all these meats to pick from.<br><br>Being ones not to shy away from day drinking, we got a glass of bubbly and a glass of rosé to pair with our meal.  In the case that you do not drink, either their white chocolate pistachio rosewater hot chocolate or their coffee is a great choice as they use 49th Parallel Beans, which is quite easy to drink, and stays flavourful without random acidic or bitter notes on the palate.<br><br>Our waitress was very polite and came over to check on how the food was partway through the meal so we didn't feel forgotten at all.<br><br>For two drinks, two wolves breakfasts and two waffles with sauce to go, it was around $70.	{'funny': 0, 'useful': 2, 'cool': 0}	4/21/2020
VPqWLp9kMiZEbctCebIZUA	DzcQEhVgW1qE94CUCguofg	5	I am completely shocked at myself that I have never posted a review for Medina Cafe... it's one of my favourite brunch spots in Vancouver. Everytime someone visits from out-of-town, I always have to bring them here! There's a reason (when the restaurant was opened) why there was always a long wait!<br><br>You can't go wrong with anything on their menu. One of my favourites is their Paella. I've also had the Cassoulet, Fricassée, and Saumon Fumé.. all delicious! My go-to drink is their Lavender Latte. It is heavenly! I honestly am not sure that I have ordered any other drink there before. <br><br>Brunch at Medina Cafe isn't complete without their Leige Waffles. They are amazing! They are especially good with their toppings. Some of my favourites are the Milk Chocolate Lavender, White Chocolate Pistachio Rosewater, and Mixed Berry Compote. So good!<br><br>With all the social distancing rules in effect, I was super ecstatic when their waffles became available for order! With ordering the waffles, I also couldn't resist ordering their Lavender Syrup from their online grocery store. I am happy to make my own Lavender Latte anytime I want!	{'funny': 0, 'useful': 1, 'cool': 1}	4/19/2020
VPqWLp9kMiZEbctCebIZUA	jisl95tZ2ia66ON1Qts60Q	5	Great brunch option in Vancouver! We ordered the Liege style waffles (passion fruit & mixed berry), Harissa burger, and wolves breakfast. It was a bit expensive but delicious! My favorite part was the waffles with the toppings - unique, sweet, and tasty. There was a wait when we got there, but if you are visiting the city there are lots of souvenir shops a short walking distance from here.	{'funny': 0, 'useful': 0, 'cool': 0}	4/2/2020

VPqWLp9kMiZEbctCebIZUA	r5vH6StCHEPsy0BjJ27EPw	3	Medina Cafe was one of the few places left standing during the COVID-19 epidemic during our short few days in Vancouver. I liked that they always kept their instagram updated with hours and take-out options. <br><br>I called in to place a waffle order, and after getting recommendations from the worker, I got three waffles with three different toppings - White Chocolate Rosewater Pistachio, Milk Chocolate Lavender, and Raspberry Caramel. When I went to pay/pick-up the order, I also added on a London Fog.<br><br>The London Fog was a huge disappointment - I didn't taste any Earl Grey, and it basically just tasted like steamed watery milk :( <br><br>The waffles on the other hand made me feel a little about this place. The waffles ($3.50 CAD each), although on the small side, were pretty good. Soft, chewy, and not too sweet. The toppings ($1 each) made them much better - I don't think I could have enjoyed all three waffles just plain. <br>Milk Chocolate Lavender - this was by far my favorite. The lavender flavor wasn't so overpowering that it tasted like soap, and the milk chocolate was super creamy and balanced well.<br>The White Chocolate Rosewater Pistachio was a lot more liquid-y than the milk chocolate, and I could taste much more pistachio than rosewater. <br>Raspberry Caramel - at first it tasted like I was just eating raspberry jam. I had to actually try the topping by itself and concentrate to taste the caramel.	{'funny': 0, 'useful': 0, 'cool': 0}	3/21/2020

All of the staffs were polite, friendly and happy. <br><br>I was seated at the bar and my meal was served rather rapidly. The smoked salmon was excellent with a creamy mayo sauce. The bread was well toasted but not crispy, and the arugula balanced everything with his bitter flavor.	{'funny': 0, 'useful': 1, 'cool': 0}	3/10/2020
VPqWLp9kMiZEbctCebIZUA	B4HHq-dKiF6Je71uc8vw0A	5	This spot really set the bar high for our trip to Vancouver. It was out first stop and I was blown away. For starters, the hostess took her time greeting us and had a huge smile. <br><br>We got seated shortly and my day/trip started out by their cappuccino. It was by far my favorite cup in the area. Smooth, beautiful, and rich in flavor. Such a comfort to my soul. <br><br>Lamb Meatball with tomato sauce was delicious. With the bread freshly baked, the acidity of the sauce balanced out with the bread to create a beautiful combination or delight. <br><br>BUT! The best was the Wolves breakfast. It's kind of a sampler of all their meats. Man, each bite was so unique and amazing. I left blown away by the quality and aroma of flavor in each bite. They curated each section with either a sauce or seasoning to bring the most of the meat. <br><br>its a MUST to come back each visit here.	{'funny': 0, 'useful': 0, 'cool': 0}	3/9/2020

The Canadian Maple syrup is a lot lighter and less viscous than American maple syrup.<br><br>I had the Fricassée Champignon - was a mushroom, egg and cheese heaven and the husband has the Saumon Fumé - smoked fish paradise. Some amazing and different food there. You don't have to be extremely adventurous to like their food (I am not). Also ordered their interesting take to a traditional Mimosa - Mimouna No. 1<br><br>P.S. After the heavy meals, my husband and i just shared one waffle.

Got the fricasée, which were two sunny eggs, braised short ribs, roasted potatoes, caramel iced onions, smoked cheddar, arugula and grilled focaccia. Really liked the braised short ribs, it was cooked just right, and worked well with the sauce. The dish was very saucy, had a lot leftover when my meal was finished. The highlight was definitely the waffles!! The sauces were rich in flavour, and very different. The waffles were fairly small, but was honestly very light and not overly sweet. I got the white chocolate pistachio rose water sauce with their orange blossom ice cream. So rich and so good! Def recommend to come and try their waffles here! Also be prepared to wait if you want to try this spot out because it can get very busy.	{'funny': 0, 'useful': 0, 'cool': 0}	3/1/2020

VPqWLp9kMiZEbctCebIZUA	DkvaAV7F4Y_rw040k0XGvQ	5	Anyone that tells you these are the best waffles ever is not over-exaggerating in the slightest. Medina Cafe literally has the best waffles ever. And their main breakfast/brunch dishes are amazing too. I had the Fricassée Champignon, which was a mixture of potatoes and mushrooms in a rich sauce with arugula and two poached eggs on top. It comes with a piece of bread that's perfect for dipping into the left-over sauce from the fricassée. As for the liège style waffles, I originally got one with the white chocolate pistachio rosewater topping. They have a range of very creative and original topping flavours, including raspberry caramel and milk chocolate lavender. The waffle was so good that I got seconds! And I would definitely go back just for the waffles. There is almost always a wait because of the cafe's popularity, so go early and put your name down. They're very organized, however, and will send you text updates if you give them your phone number. I highly recommend this spot to anyone visiting Vancouver.	{'funny': 0, 'useful': 0, 'cool': 0}	2/23/2020

Servers, blah all dirty, touching their ears, face, touching/scratching their hair, yucks, I am very particular when I go to restaurants, I really pay attention to the server's personal hygiene.

VPqWLp9kMiZEbctCebIZUA	2YE6YRPy_PmKh96moolwVA	5	Delicious liege waffle, many dipping selections, nice service.<br><br>There are many waffle shops in downtown area. Heard Medina is super famous but long wait, decided to give a try anyway. Got here around 11am, was told wait time for 2 is about 90 mins. Left  name and phone number, they'll text once table is ready. We toured around the area while waiting. About 70 mins, we walked back, host got us seated at the bar. <br><br>We ordered 2 waffles with 2 dipping sauce, a paella and roasted potato as side. Waitress was pretty nice to ask us if we want waffle first while waiting for paella. The waffle is as hard as I thought it would be, instead it's chewy and creamy. Dipping sauce we got white chocolate rose water and salted caramel. White chocolate dip is great, not too sweet and goes really well with waffles. Husband didn't really like the salted caramel even though that's his favorite thing for all kinds dessert. The caramel taste a bit burnt or something about it doesn't goes well with the waffle. But the waffle was so good I ended up ordering another one.<br><br>As soon as we finished waffle, paella and potato were served. Paella has a bunch of fresh veggie in it which made it quite refreshing. And the sausage used in paella was outstanding. Potato is quite great, it's crispy on the outside and well baked inside. Along with cheese that got baked on top of potato and the dipping sauce make it one of the best breakfast potato I ever had. <br><br>Chatted with the waitress a bit, seems like store is always busy. And they don't take reservations. So if planning to eat here, prepare to wait for 1 hour.	{'funny': 0, 'useful': 0, 'cool': 0}	2/17/2020

Service was sub par and dining experience was rushed - i didn't feel like a guest, i felt like a costumer. in my 5 years of working in food service, i know this is not the impression you want to leave as a restaurant.

Had the paella and my friend had the fricassee. Paella was good, spicy chorizo, avocodo, egg, and made it a good mix and was a new taste in my books, but I'd try the whole fricassee to myself next time, pork was super tender! The waffles were typical good Belgian waffles, chocolate lavender topping was a good compliment - lavender hints super strong. Would come back, old style feel is gorgeous, service is mediocre but I sat down fast and my food was delish so I don't care much.	{'funny': 0, 'useful': 0, 'cool': 0}	2/12/2020

We actually only had to wait about an hour before we checked and got a seat (this was Sunday 11-12 too), so we decided to just order their dessert items.<br><br>We got 4 waffles with different dipping sauces (Milk chocolate lavender, salted caramel, mixed berry compote, and creme de fruit de passione) and 2 caneles. The milk chocolate lavender was so good, mostly because it was like fondue, followed closely by the salted caramel. The caneles were lukewarm, and were better when dipped in the sauces.	{'funny': 0, 'useful': 1, 'cool': 1}	2/8/2020

Came here on recommendation from our hotel, so glad we gave it no hesitation. Great space and wonderful service. Started off with the waffles..might have to take some to go! Shared the cassoulet and fricassee, served in an iron skillet. Keeping all the flavors nice and hot.  Different for what I normally would have for breakfast so this is a plus for me for its uniqueness. Make sure to add this to your list!	{'funny': 0, 'useful': 0, 'cool': 0}	2/5/2020

It also seems to attract a really interesting clientele; lots of travelers. Yes the wait to get in is long, but use the opportunity to chat with others waiting. So many fascinating people there.	{'funny': 0, 'useful': 0, 'cool': 0}	2/1/2020
VPqWLp9kMiZEbctCebIZUA	C1Z4F_Fk7ijRdPonX6BsIA	5	This place is for all breakfast lovers, waffles from here are a must!! They taste so fresh and there are many different syrups and sides you can get! One of the sides was caramel and another was a berry spread. The waffles come with this delicious powdered sugar drilled on the top which adds to the taste. I got a yummy coffee with my waffles and let me just say, it was the best decision in the cold Vancouver weather. The waffles are pretty tiny so I'd recommend getting 2-3. <br><br>Parking is a little difficult but the place is so worth it.

Got their Milk Chocolate Lavander dip again and I loveeeeee it. The Lavender flavour sticks to your tongue and it's a weird feeling  but good kind of weird. Got to try a small portion of their Le Complet and the steaks were done perfectly. Would definitely order this agai	{'funny': 0, 'useful': 1, 'cool': 1}	1/29/2020

I was expecting more steak, but the flavors were great. <br><br>We came in during Monday morning around 10am, luckily we were able to get parking right outside (metered) and the wait was only about 10 minutes.

We got here as early as we could (8:30) and the wait for 5 people was an hour but the food was worth every minute we spent in line.

When we finally got our table, we were all so torn on what to order because everything sounded amazing. And everything was amazing indeed. <br><br>We all ordered different dishes so we could try everything; I got Les Boulettes because I love spicy Morrocan lamb meatballs and it was absolutely phenomenal.

VPqWLp9kMiZEbctCebIZUA	P-NZ1b9FDJQg2ui9n3qwzg	4	One of the best brunches hands down in Vancouver but be prepared to wait. I've been several times over the years usually when I have family or friends visiting and would highly recommend getting the lavender latte which they are famous for along with their homemade waffles. Sorry no gluten free<br>waffles yet but our waiter, Marcelo said he's hopeful one day they will offer a GF waffle option? Since I usually order the tagine (tomato stew with chickpeas, olives and comes with a small merguez aka - lamb sausage) and 2 poached eggs, which is a classic French Moroccan dish that exemplifies this restaurant's cuisine, and just the right amount of indulgence. But, as I wanted to change it up from what I typically order and wanted something lighter to save room for their waffle with the lavender latte to finish off a fabulous way to enjoy Sunfunday in this not so fun rainy weather. I ordered the Le Thon, ras el naout (Mediterranean rub) seared tuna with quinoa/greens and it was delicious. Even though, it was before 11am, Marcelo was kind enough to check with the kitchen if they could accommodate it earlier and they did (expressed my gratitude in his tip). Now for dessert, you choose from several dipping sauces (optional) for the waffle and my friend ordered the chocolate lavender sauce which complemented the lavender latte perfectly. My friends enjoyed what they ordered and you cannot go wrong as everything on their menu is on point. Tip, go early to put your name down.	{'funny': 0, 'useful': 0, 'cool': 0}	1/19/2020

p5thThuUITUjAy8gS3sPMw	3UZkHNH5h9O07SdcwQYVIA	5	Had dinner here 3 of the 4 nights I was visiting Kitsilano from Seattle. Occasionally I've found Yelp reviews to be overinflated when visiting other cities (looking at you, Portland) however Fable fully deserves the excellent reputation it's garnered.<br>Food: Favorite entree was a tie between the gnocchi with a double add pork belly and duck breast (seriously, order both!), closely followed by the steak. The steak's crispy potato was understated however the two cheese aligot (aka cheesy whipped potatoes) which also comes with this entree was my overall favorite side, so it balanced out.<br>Favorite appetizers were the duck meatball and tomato soup, beets were solid. The $3-4 appetizers were cute and flavorful. There is nothing I regret eating and all the price points are reflective of portion size. Overall I agree their pricing falls somewhere between $$(Yelp)-$$$(Google) but when you factor in the amazing quality relative to what you pay I agree with Yelp's classification of $$ for value.<br>Sat at the kitchen bar and enjoyed watching the plating. I like that the open kitchen concept since it helped me optimize for what to try for subsequent visits. I have no regrets about eating the gnocchi twice and duck/steak once during this trip. However if I come back next things I would order are the sablefish (I overlooked seafood but one table ordered this for 3 of their 4 entrees so going to assume they know something I don't) and get the duck again, only mildly curious about the rissoto or salmon although both looked beautiful.<br><br>Usually when I eat out, I straight up optimize for taste/value and am ambivalent to the dining experience but Fable delivered on that too, which I must begrudgingly admit won me over. The restaurant manager not only remembered me when I came back on the second evening, he remembered how I liked my water (I can barely get some places in Seattle to recognize me if I go in once every week, much less care about my preference for non-monetary items). Skipped a night eating there and when I came back, the hostess still remembered where I like to sit. Service throughout the meal was attentive without feeling intrusive, ambience/decor was very nice, I haven't worked in a restaurant before but this place generally seemed to have the dynamics of an engaged and high-functioning team (e.g. servers double-checking plated orders before delivering them to tables, everyone in the kitchen voicing their opinion on what keeps things running well on the back-end). There were also smaller interactions that made me feel like the staff genuinely cared whether I had a good experience (e.g. not blanket recommending the higher-priced or daily special when asked for their opinion between two entree options, I was explicitly reminded not to tip by % when my bill included a gift card). Hope I'll get to visit Vancouver again soon because this was the perfect spot to unwind and enjoy great food after a long day.	{'funny': 1, 'useful': 5, 'cool': 0}	12/16/2019

I sampled the veggie frittata with creamy goats cheese, asparagus, and a healthy pile of greens on top, served with DELICIOUS potatoes rösti, a side of toast, and housemade raspberry jam. All of the components came together beautifully, and the rösti are more like sophisticated flattened tater tots (in the best possible way!).

The chickpea fritter appeared to be a simple falafel, but it was much, much more. A potato-like and crispy textures were complemented by its golden sauce and crisp, fresh herb toppings. It was gone in two bites, needless to say.  The ""canned tuna,"" was anything but--and I can't help but appreciate the effective and comedic use of irony here--consisted of fried bread and a gourmet fish dipping. The combination was a hit with us, and it was almost immediately eaten entirely--mostly by me. It was like eating luxury tuna on luxury rice (that's a good thing).  And I haven't even gotten to the ribs, but when I did it was gone in an instant. Whatever the sweet, nectar-like sauce was it was an addicting flavour that I couldn't get enough of. The basil surprisingly went well with the ribs and the tender, savoury beans were an excellent complement to the sweet, crispy ribs. Last but not least is the gnocchi. It is indeed non-traditional, but it is exceptional that it melts away any expectations. It pairs excellently with the smooth, white cream and the yellow squash purée to form a triage of comfort and indelible soothing softness.  To round out an already wholesome dish, soft pumpkin seeds and seared kale are added to the fray to complete this dish. <br><br>This was my first time at Fable, so I was not expecting anything, yet I was blown away by this culinary experience.  Not only was the food great, but so was the service. Not to mention the washroom was clean and spacious with some subtle lighting--perfect for one of those ""bathroom selfies""... Of course, the restaurant itself is great for photos as the wooden beams and red brick make for a vibrant background.<br><br>I'll still rate this as five stars because of the masterful food.

Luckily we arrived prior to the table of 16.  Water was served immediately but our fabletini's arrived very late, after our first appy was 1/2 finished.  The Fabletini was delicious and not sweet.  I don't know if restaurant has a dedicated bar tender as I saw her also bringing food to the tables, perhaps this is why it took so long to get our drinks.  Our first appy, canned tuna, was OK but nothing to write home about.  The bread that it came with actually had more taste.  The second appy came from the daily specials and was 4 deepfried oysters with tartar sauce $5 each:  This was excellent.  I ordered the BC Halibut which I believe came with short ribs.  The Halibut was overcooked and very dry.  The risotto with peas was more peas than risotto and it was swimming in ""water"", not at all like pictures I've seen with a brown sauce, you would need a spoon to eat it as it was more like a soup.  I've never had such bad risotto.  The unidentifiable meat was hard, dried out and chewy. I make very moist, falling apart short ribs which these small ( very small) chunks were not! I have to laugh as the meat actually looked like ""hard turds"" in the bowl.  I exchanged my meal with my husband as I wouldn't have been able to finish it as it was unappetizing and lacking in seasoning, needed salt or something.  The other meal was off the specials list which was a ragu with rabbit, beef and another meat.  The  pasta with the ragu was supposed to be a rigatoni but my husband substituted for another pasta.  The ragu was tasty but the pasta was overcooked. The ragu was a much better option though then Fables take on surf 'N turf.  Dessert was Lemon Meringue parfait which was tasty, sweet and tart.  I ordered a Montecristo coffee which was well made but the restaurant doesn't have whipping cream so I had to have coffee cream in it.  I would bring my own wine and pay a corkage fee. The wine that I ordered, Sage Hill Pinot Gris was not available.  The restaurant was not full as there were empty tables and the bar emptied out about 8:30.  They do tell you that you have 2 hours to complete your meal when making a reservation."	{'funny': 0, 'useful': 0, 'cool': 0}	8/25/2019

The food we ordered made each person eager to share a piece of their meal ... and each taste supported another reason to come back another time.  1) pork shoulder Bennie....cornbread was the base, the hollaindaise amazing, the pork moist and flavorful,  it had some barbeque sauce which I was hesitant about but it worked!  2) Wes's meatball skillet reminded me of the meatball shop in NY....meatballs moist and tasty with the Italian flavors in the sauce as an added bonus. 3) our sweet tooth son had his French toast which was enjoyed by all...no syrup needed.  4) Johnny cakes was similar to mine except my daughter's pancakes had a cornmeal base...it was oh so moist and had the softness of a pancake.  There was that tasty shredded pork on top..yum yum.  Would we come back?  A definite yup yup.	{'funny': 0, 'useful': 1, 'cool': 0}	8/19/2019

We planned to have dinner before the fireworks and we're thrilled when we were able to get a spot at Fable last minute! <br><br>The restaurant from the exterior doesn't look like anything special but walking just a few steps inside confirmed that this reservation was a good choice. We walked past the bar in front of the open kitchen and I cannot lie I was a little envious of their seats!! I love cooking and sitting there would have been a dream watching them put out all of those plates of pure pleasure. Haha we did keep walking though, our table was at the back of this intimate and simple modern farmhouse restaurant. <br><br>Our waiter was funny, engaging and efficient. He had a great knowledge of the ingredients used in the menu that is developed from a farm to table concept. I love this type of cooking so it was super enjoyable hearing the great attention to providing food that was as equally delicious as it was fresh and local. <br><br>The drink menu has something for everyone, our husbands don't drink alcohol so having some really creative non-alcoholic beverages was really well received. Haha as was the knowledge our server had of the wine menu, as us girls did enjoy a glass of wine with our meals!<br><br>The food was very satisfying! The freshness, the creativity, the presentation, the flavour profiles all bang on! <br><br>Thank you Fable for lending us a seat for such an enjoyable night of great food, laughter and conversation. We will highly recommended and hope to be back soon!	{'funny': 2, 'useful': 3, 'cool': 1}	8/8/2019
p5thThuUITUjAy8gS3sPMw	IOmvfNALWe47h5exBufvqA	4	Fable has been on my list for a long time and I'm disappointed it has taken me so long to try it out! I love that they support local farms and get fresh ingredients daily. They even have a rooftop garden to grow some of their own ingredients. <br>We came here for my birthday dinner and were greeted quickly by the hostess. They have an open kitchen right at the front with bar seating as well as regular tables in the back. <br><br>We were told by the server that their dishes are meant to be family style which for me is the most ideal for trying a bit of everything. <br><br>OYSTER FISH & CHIPS - Each order is only 1 piece of a medium sized beer battered fried oyster on tartar, topped with mini french fries. It was a perfect spoonful of deliciousness. The batter was light and the tartar was a refreshing balance. <br><br>ROOFTOP SERRANO PEPPERS - This appy was quite large for the 2 of us. There were about 16 small roasted peppers in a white foam, topped with some chicharron. The spiciness of peppers are always a surprise but don't worry these range between a little sweet to mildly (2/10) spicy. <br><br>SMOKED DUCK BREAST - Perfectly cooked tender duck breast with roasted parsnip, duck confit croquette and cabbage. The croquette tasted more like a carrot, potato croquette however. <br><br>BC HALIBUT with SHORT RIB  on pea risotto, miso and halibut dashi. This dish was my least favourite because the halibut was overcooked. The halibut was pan fried, leaving the outside crispy but the inside dry. There were only a few small pieces of short ribs but they were quite tender. The pea risotto with the dashi was tasty even with so many peas in it! <br><br>Overall a wonderful birthday dinner.	{'funny': 0, 'useful': 0, 'cool': 0}	8/2/2019

p5thThuUITUjAy8gS3sPMw	CZTnYFMqq_dd910yWRI2AQ	5	I am personally a huge fan of Fable. My favourite go-to dish is the gnocchi- it is absolutely amazing ! It has such great flavour, and the texture is to die for. They used to serve it with pulled pork, which I miss dearly because personally I believe it combined much better than the pork belly. <br>Their chickpea fritters are another one of my favourites- everything is so perfectly balanced out- the garnishes (pickled onion and sprouts) compensate for the heaviness of the frying. And the sauce is absolutely delicious. <br>You can always count on Fable for everything to be perfectly cooked (Like their poached eggs ! Always and Instagram-worthy ooze when you cut into it),<br>There are only two downsides that I can think of. The first might be the fact that it's on the pricier side, but the quality of the ingredients and the effort and detailing given to the preparation of the food make the cost understandable. The second is that sometimes in terms of flavour, the dishes your order (if you try to switch it up from what you usually order) might be a little hit and miss, but this is probably due to the fact that everyone has different flavour preferences. There are so many specials and the menu rotates so often and changes so often that sometimes you might fall in love with a dish just for it to disappear a few months later (*insert broken heart emoji*), but at least this really demonstrates how they focus on having the freshest most in-season ingredients and that they're constantly focused on finding and showcasing the best flavours.	{'funny': 0, 'useful': 1, 'cool': 1}	6/18/2019

This is definitely a ""fancier"" brunch place. So it is a little bit more pricey but they present their food like it's a high end restaurant and fable means farm to table which means that they source everything from local farms. I got the farmers muffin which I did enjoy with a side of bacon. I did liked their black peppered jam it was complimented the sausage so we'll. Their potatoes were nice and crispy and soft in the inside.  Portions are small(for guys mostly), my boyfriend left still hungry, I felt satisfied, not overly full but it was a good enough portion for me"	{'funny': 1, 'useful': 1, 'cool': 1}	3/31/2019

We just popped in hoping there would be a place for us and they did a great job accommodating us. The restaurant has a fun vibe with an awesome and unique chandelier in the center and interesting art on the walls. The whole restaurant is pretty small including the dining area, a tiny little open kitchen, and a couple small bathrooms in the back. They do a good job with the space though and have lots of nice seating. <br><br>Our server was really nice and attentive. They have some gluten free options on their menu and she was able to point me in the right direction. The husband can never turn down a grilled cheese, the little boy inside him wins every time. He was all smiles on the other side of the table as it disappeared so I think it was pretty spot on.

I was surprised but it also meant we got the pick of seat and the full attention of the staff, which was really nice.<br>I was soooo excited to see that they had a Croque Madam on the menu, one of my favorite warm, cheesy with egg sandwiches. It was amazing! I loved it! It had pickled onion, with two beautifully soft eggs on top and a bacon jam with ham inside. It had a Parmesan foam as well and I wasn't sure what that was going to be like, but it was amazing! A definite must try! <br>I like the sweet and savoury breakfast sandwich, my husband not as much.

We ordered the french toast and the ham benedict. The former was quite good- the fresh fruit and berry compote complemented the sweetness of the bread nicely. The benedict was also good, though non-traditional because of the olive oil-based hollandaise. We also had some blueberry and orange juice mimosas.

It was fun having a close up view of the chefs making the dishes but the proximity to the stoves made my face hot and my clothes smell. Still, the food was delicious and the service excellent.

Except portion wise. Mine was so small, I stole a good chunk of the Mrs gnocchi to keep from starving.<br><br>I realize for higher end meals to fit into a smaller budget, it often leads to dine out menus essentially being tasting menus. I would prefer a higher priced but more ""entree sized"" main.<br><br>We ordered 1 of each dessert... initially. Both the lemon meringue parfait and sticky date pudding were mind blowing. The lemon meringue parfait: with London Fog ice cream (yes, probably from Rain or Shine; nearby and tastes identical to theirs) and struesel, perfectly balanced lemon curd. <br><br>We've been hooked on trying different sticky puddings since trying Gordon Ramsey's at his Steak House in Vegas (often with less than desirable results). This one was so good, that it didn't need ice cream to balance it.

Our server was attentive, patient, and gave good recommendations on food. <br><br>Overall the food was on the saltier side. The appetizers and vegetables are small-medium sized and good for sharing. <br>Definitely recommend: <br>- Brussel sprouts: crispy brussel sprouts with a good crunch on the outside. Was not overly oily. Rest of the dishes were on the saltier side but this was seasoned perfectly.  Pistachios added a good crunnchhh <br>- king oyster mushrooms: a little heavy on the parmesan side for my personal taste but the mushrooms were very fresh  <br>Meh: <br>- Spaghetti & meatball (ducks): Wayyy too salty. The cream pasta sauce is pretty rich with good flavors but the flavors were overshadowed by the salt. The meatball was a slightly overcooked for duck meat and again very salty. I think if they made a few smaller meatballs instead of one large meatball, it may cook more evenly. <br>Drinks: <br>- Caesar was decent, pretty standard <br><br>Overall, a good experience and would go back again to try their brunch menu but beware of the salty dishes!	{'funny': 0, 'useful': 0, 'cool': 0}	1/1/2019

I'd come here every time I visit Vancouver!<br><br>When we arrived in Vancouver, on our first day eating at a restaurant, our server told us that it would be cloudy and rainy during our entire trip and the sun would never come out. I didn't appreciate the negativity, but thank goodness that she was an awful meteorologist because she was terribly wrong! We were at Grandville Public Market, and I checked my Weather App, which had full sunshine from 2-430pm. Let's go! Biking around Stanley Park was one of the thing we really wanted to do when we arrived, and I'm so happy that we had the perfect weather.<br><br>Needless to say, Stanley Park is HUGE! It's literally a peninsula that connects downtown Vancouver to the North. We came in from along the shore, and parked at the first lot nearest the bicycle rentals. We grabbed a couple of bikes from the Mobi by Shaw Go racks and after signing up, paying, entering codes, and going through the ""it's like riding a bike"" process, on we went! I haven't ridden a bicycle in twenty years! Still got it!<br><br>Biking through the entire park, including several stops for photos, meeting a famous championship winning professional sports player who I promised I would not mention in any social media or the like, and just scenery gazing took almost 90 minutes. There are dedicated bike paths and it's only one way, so you don't need to worry about pedestrians and oncoming bike traffic, but be wary of bicyclists from behind as not all of them ring their bells beforehand. The pathways are very well kept and quite an easy and enjoyable bike ride.<br><br>You see many landmarks from the Lost Lagoon to the Deadman Island in Coal Harbour to under the Lion's Gate bridge and back along the Seawall and English Bay. There's so much greenery, beautiful trees, and the air is so fresh. The best thing was that the sun was out and shining with bright blue skies. After finishing our bicycling, I felt great! Even though my inner thighs were kinda numb lol. We were able to catch the sunset which was just beautiful.<br><br>Overall, this was a memorable experience. We spent about two hours here that included biking the entire park and catching the sunset. Two hours seems short, but I enjoyed every second of it, so it felt a lot longer. The park is so well maintained, beautiful, clean, relaxed, and enjoyable.

We had a pleasant twenty minute stroll from downtown to the Vancouver Aquarium. The walkways are wide and the park is rather clean. I was also thrilled at the newfound sight of all the black squirrels running around the park!	{'funny': 2, 'useful': 0, 'cool': 1}	9/26/2019
kajMc2fkWKdzKJ1M4pm47Q	N6LeUJGpsS3vP5Rtz1TtKA	5	Oh, this place is awesome. Wish American cities could have something like this - Golden Gate Park certainly doesn't reach this level, that is for sure.<br><br>To summarize the advantages:<br><br>1) It is within walking distance of downtown.<br>2) Although a major artery runs from downtown to North Vancouver and beyond, one barely notices it as the running and biking paths circumvent it, yet manage to incorporate an awesome view of Lions Gate Bridge.<br>3) Lots of facilities, including but not limited to: Restrooms, playgrounds, a water park, an aquarium, food stalls, boating facilities.<br>4) I'm sure it's partly due to the people who patronize it, but the area is remarkably clean - hardly a piece of litter was to be spotted.<br><br>Yes, there are issues with parking, but I'm sure that's part of the charm - after all, you really shouldn't feel obligated to drive here.	{'funny': 0, 'useful': 0, 'cool': 2}	9/24/2019
kajMc2fkWKdzKJ1M4pm47Q	bxJfL_Vl1DxFiQSaVoqCsQ	5	Best park I've seen - and we only saw a small piece of it.  Spectacular, large trees mixed with beautiful, blooming plants plus walking trails, seaplanes buzzing overhead to land on the water, the aquarium and artistic totems.  Wow!	{'funny': 0, 'useful': 0, 'cool': 2}	9/18/2019
kajMc2fkWKdzKJ1M4pm47Q	pOMPcG5wXWfPOW4aQeY0JQ	4	Stanley Park is a must visit if you're going to be in Vancouver! It is such a big park with so many things you could do. There's multiple views of the city from all points around the park!<br><br>You have the option of just driving around and doing a few laps. You could also walk around or rent a bike. <br><br>Just make sure you pay for parking!! Even if it's just to hop out and take a quick picture, you will be ticketed (speaking from experience unfortunately).	{'funny': 0, 'useful': 2, 'cool': 1}	9/14/2019
kajMc2fkWKdzKJ1M4pm47Q	YBT3EKUNN4IP8m4x7sGu1g	4	It is lovely.<br><br>It is a natural park with trees and manicured flower beds on the borders of the main pavillion.<br><br>The redwood trees are huge.  Impossible to describe. The walking trails and running paths are very well-maintained.  Strict on-leash rules for dog owners.  There is also an Aquarium at Stanley.<br><br>You can meander over to the water and watch the herons and ducks.<br><br>Stanley is well-known and well-utilized for good reason.  It is thE ultimate escape in the middle of Vancouver.	{'funny': 0, 'useful': 3, 'cool': 0}	9/14/2019
kajMc2fkWKdzKJ1M4pm47Q	4Ry0q14UDewv2LMa2wibCQ	5	Stanley Park is synonymous with Vancouver - you just cannot miss it, even if you are only in town for a day. The park is HUGE - definitely do your research on the areas you want to explore before heading in. I recommend walking or biking a portion of the seawall loop, the totem pole park, and the various gardens. If you are looking for a quick overview with history of the park, enjoy one of their 1-hour horse-drawn carriage rides!	{'funny': 0, 'useful': 1, 'cool': 1}	9/4/2019
kajMc2fkWKdzKJ1M4pm47Q	WSQIrbsHu5dY2Te_cKCXGg	5	Incredible Sight and Sound beautifully kept Seawall that is top of the world and surrounding forest that run all the way to English Bay. Stanley park is truly the gem of Vancouver and a must-see for anybody visiting or even locals that haven't been here in a long time. Whether it's the occasional stroll after work or a bicycle ride around the beach on a sunny afternoon it's truly a free luxury in a pricy city that we should all enjoy more.	{'funny': 0, 'useful': 0, 'cool': 1}	8/29/2019
kajMc2fkWKdzKJ1M4pm47Q	pwQ8E-hbDUJe3qtKt_IBBg	5	Stanley Park is gorgeous!! You can do so much here. There's an aquarium, a pool, a beach, a train ride, a playground, and so much more that I didn't even get to see in one day. Definitely the best park I have ever been to because of all the different scenery and options.	{'funny': 4, 'useful': 10, 'cool': 8}	8/28/2019
kajMc2fkWKdzKJ1M4pm47Q	t36rYAFcx6_FlGvGl7mfxw	4	A cool park. It's massive and definitely hard to walk all over. Might be ideal for a bike ride. The mini train only allows dogs on Sundays unless they're service dogs. There's a playground next to it if you have kids that want to play. The rose garden is pretty and nearby too.	{'funny': 0, 'useful': 1, 'cool': 1}	8/23/2019
kajMc2fkWKdzKJ1M4pm47Q	JEPDG3TLwqOQTPztScdeSA	4	Lovely, expansive, surrounded by water (and a loop for bicycles) with grassy fields, tree covering and so much...space. <br><br>This feels like the Central Park of Vancouver, a gathering place for city dwellers and tourists alike. Bring a picnic, walk a dog, enjoy a game of frisbee with friends, there's certainly something for everyone at Stanley Park.	{'funny': 4, 'useful': 12, 'cool': 10}	8/20/2019
kajMc2fkWKdzKJ1M4pm47Q	oIaQxF5jHfx8nc9VZpq8gA	5	Always our first stop in the city, strap on your walking shoes and head out on a big ole loop of this park (although I have done it in both tennis shoes and heeled boots, both were fine). We usually walk from Canada Place all the way to and through the park and back! On the way in you pass boats with fun names, cute waterfront eateries, and all the dedicated benches lining the promenade. When you get into the park you see a great view of the city, the float planes taking off, and we even caught a seal on the beach... dead... but still! The totem pole park is great and if you walk up to the fields you may stumble upon sporting events- we saw a cricket tournament! When I did this in March it was empty and we were able to take our time. Most recently, in June, there were more tourists and locals out for a run or bike ride. Still a great place to visit and such a fun walk about!	{'funny': 1, 'useful': 0, 'cool': 1}	8/16/2019
