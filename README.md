# VanHacks2020
This application was created to be showcased at VanHacks 2020, a annual hackathon organized by TTT Studios around VSW dedicated to helping those helping our community. 
The team consists of three members: Jon Kim, Yen Ching Tan, and Gallant Tang.
We worked using python for both front and back end development on VSCode with live share due to social distancing policies as a result of covid.
# Introduction
The application has a number of functions.

## Data mining – Gallant
Gallant is responsible for creating the code used to mine data from Yelp's fusion API as well as other sources. We collected data on about 1000 restaurants in Vancouver and the reviews left by their customers.

## Data preprocessing and analysis – Jon & Gallant
Gallant & Jon are responsible for fitting, transforming, and training the LDA and NLP model using gensim LDA, NLTK, and spaCy.
We learned to create the `bag of words` through gensim for latent dirichlet analysis. Coherence testing and randomized search cv is used to fine tune parameters.

## UI/UX – Gallant & Yen
Yen & Gallant are responsible for developing the user interface. The application is created using Python Flask.
